# Road traffic signal lights
The Road Traffic Signal Lights Changing project is a simulation created with React and Redux Toolkit, aimed at mimicking real-world traffic scenarios. It incorporates pure CSS and JavaScript for styling and logic, respectively, to create an interactive and visually appealing experience. The project features four roads, each with its corresponding set of traffic signals, emulating real traffic intersections. To enhance realism, the signals display countdown timers for signal changes, providing users with a dynamic and immersive experience. Furthermore, the addition of moving cars on the roads adds to the authenticity of the simulation, with cars moving when the signals turn green.
